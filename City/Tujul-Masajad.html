            The Taj-ul-Masajid largely takes inspiration from Mughal architecture.[8] The mosque has a pink facade topped by two 18-storey high octagonal minarets with marble domes, an impressive main hallway with attractive pillars, and marble flooring resembling the likes of Jama Masjid in Delhi and the Badshahi Mosque of Lahore.[9] It has a courtyard with a large ablution tank in the centre. It has a double-storeyed gateway with four recessed archways and nine cusped multifold openings in the main prayer hall. The massive pillars in the hall hold 27 ceilings through squinted arches of which 16 ceilings are decorated with ornate petalled designs

                            Nawab Shah Jahan Begum of Bhopal. While records vary, the initial phase of construction is believed to have started around 1871 according to some sources, while others suggest 1887 as the commencement year. The mosque was envisioned as a grand structure within the newly established walled area of Shahjahanabad in Bhopal. Its design was strategically planned near three water bodies: Munshi Hussain Talab, Noor Mahal Talab, and Motia Talab, enhancing its scenic and spiritual ambiance.

                After the death of Shah Jahan Begum in 1901, her daughter, Sultan Jahan Begum, took over the project, continuing the work till her demise. The mosque's construction saw contributions from various individuals, including the involvement of Hamidullah Khan who constructed one of its gates as per Shah Jahan Begum's suggestions. The construction pace fluctuated and finally concluded in 1958, managed in its later years by Islamic scholar Imran Khan Nadwi and his brother Salman Khan Nadwi, at a total cost of 20 million Indian rupees. Notably, the entrance of the mosque was later renovated, incorporating motifs from 13th century Syrian mosques, a heartfelt donation by the Emir of Kuwait in remembrance of his late wife, adding a layer of international cultural heritage to the mosque’s architectural grandeur.

            The Taj-ul-Masajid, initiated by Nawab Shah Jahan Begum of Bhopal in the late 19th century, stands as a monumental example of Islamic architecture in India. Construction began ambiguously around 1871 or 1887 and continued through generations, with Shah Jahan Begum's daughter, Sultan Jahan Begum, furthering her mother's legacy until her death. The mosque, located amidst three picturesque water bodies—Munshi Hussain Talab, Noor Mahal Talab, and Motia Talab—was completed in 1958 under the guidance of Islamic scholars Imran Khan Nadwi and Salman Khan Nadwi. The mosque, which incurred a cost of 20 million Indian rupees, also features a beautifully renovated entrance adorned with motifs donated by the Emir of Kuwait, commemorating his late wife and linking the structure to broader Islamic architectural traditions.
